Practice with method chaining
=============================


Modify the RPGCharacter example, by implementing new methods for the RPGCharacter ADT. The methods should be:

-> foundLevelUp() 
when the method is called, the character should receive 100 experience points (XP) and heal completely. 
Test that your method "chains" like all the others.

-> drinkPotion(potionName)
the parameter potionName is a string, and it can be one of 3: 
	- "yellow", "blue" or "green" potions.
If the character drings a yellow potion, it looses 10 health points, but receives 10 coins. 
Drinking the blue potions kills you instantly; while drinking a green potion restores you health to 100 and increases your XP of 2.
Any potion with other names should have no effect on the character.



[Advanced] Change the RPGCharacter constructor: add attributes  luck  and  strength .

- RPGCharacter should also return a randomized character every time. 
  Randomize: health in [70,100], xp in [10,50], luck in [2,8] and strength in [2,8]. 

- Change the function getDamage, so that if strength is more than 6, only half of the damage is taken.

- Change the function foundCoins, so that if luck is more than 6, amountOfCoins is doubled before 
  adding it to the current money.

- Finally, change the printState function to print also the new attributes. 

Test your new RPGCharacter by creating 3 characters, 
then make them attack, get damage and find coins.
