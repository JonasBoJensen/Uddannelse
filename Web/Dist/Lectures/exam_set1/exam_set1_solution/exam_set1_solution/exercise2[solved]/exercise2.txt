Exercise 2
==========

Work with a responsive, flex-grid. In the code I'm using Respond.js.
The text in the example is taken from the book Postsingular by R. Rucker.


1) Change the HTML page so that the paragraph with title 'From Chpt 2: "Nant Day"' 
only occupies 2 columns, instead of 3 as it does now.

2) Change again the HTML page. Add a new DIV with a picture of the cover of the book.
The image should always occupy 1 column, at any resulution. 
Place the cover image to the left of the section with title 'Source'.
I provided the cover image in file: images/cover.jpg

3) 
In the css you can see that the breakpoints are:
320px , 480px , 600px , 768px , 1024px , 1280px , 1400px

In the CSS file you will see a comment like the following:

/*
FOLDING FLUID GRID

< 767px			- 1-Column Fluid Grid

768px - 1023px		- 2-Column Fluid Grid

> 1024px		- 3-Column Fluid Grid

Change widths as necessary
*/

Change the breakpoint, so that the 1-column is active only below 600px.
