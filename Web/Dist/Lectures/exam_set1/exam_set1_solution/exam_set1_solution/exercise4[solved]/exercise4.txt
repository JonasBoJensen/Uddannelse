Exercise 4
==========

Look at the file: forestGenerator.html

You need to generate a description of a forest that has from 3 to 8 trees (use a random value to decide how many).
Each tree can have: 
- a broken branch -> 30% probability of having it
- and 0 to 6 leaves (use a random value to decide how many)

Each broken branck can have (or not, 50% probabilty):
- a leaf
         
Using jQuery:
1) Write a program that generates a random forest, using
   nested DIVs to represent the trees, broken branches, and leaves.

2) When the user clicks the button, place the bird on the first tree in your forest 
   (inside the DIV representing a tree) with a broken branch.
   If in your current forest no trees have a broken brance, place the bird on the first tree.

Note: there is already a DIV with ID bird. 
      You need to remove it and place it at the appropriate place, when the button is clicked.
