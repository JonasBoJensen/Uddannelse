/* 
Determine if two strings are anagram or not.
Def: any word that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram.

E.g.
  silent = listen
  William Shakespeare = I am a weakish speller

[hint]
A simple solution would be to sort given strings.

// Note: strings cannot be sorted directly in Javascript, but arrays can be sorted; so...
var array = 'andrea'.split('');

var sorted = array.sort();
