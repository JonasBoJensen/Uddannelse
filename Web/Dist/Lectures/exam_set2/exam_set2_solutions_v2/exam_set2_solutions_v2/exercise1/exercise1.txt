Exercise 1
==========

Look in the file pizza.html

There is a constructor function for the Pizza data-type.
In this program:
- A pizza has a name, a price and it can be organic or not. 
- A pizza can provide its own description, with a toString method.

What you have to do:
1) Finish implementing the Pizza  constructor, so that each Pizza object
   actually has the right attributes.
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the assertions in the file, in section:
       // 1) testing the Pizza constructor
   should pass correctly, without errors.
   
2) Finish implementing the toString function, so that it
   returns a string describing the current pizza.
   For example, a pizza with name 'Abc' and price 123, and organic, will be described as:
      'Pizza *Abc*, price 123kr, organic'
   for non-organic pizza, like name 'Xyz' and price 666, and not organic, the description is:
      'Pizza *Xyz*, price 666kr'
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the assertions in the file, in section:  
      // 2) testing the toString method
   should pass correctly, without errors.
      
3) I created an array with 4 pizza, then I saved it in the localstorage.
   You should load the array  aCloneOfTheTable  from localstorage, so it becomes a clone of 
   the  tableOrder  array.
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the assertions in the file, in section:  
      // 3) testing an array of pizzas
   should pass correctly, without errors.
      
4) Print the price of each pizza in the array. Use a for-loop.
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the 
   assertions in the file, in section:  
      // 4) print the price of each pizza in the array
   should pass correctly, without errors.
