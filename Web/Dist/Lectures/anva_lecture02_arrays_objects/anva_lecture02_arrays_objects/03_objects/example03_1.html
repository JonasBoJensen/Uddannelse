// Declarations and printing
var book = { topic: "Eloquent Javascript", fat: true };
console.log( book.topic );  // or book[”topic”] 
book.author = "Marijn Haverbeke";   // create new property
console.log( book.author );

// Reading a property that doesn’t exist will produce the value undefined
console.log( book.price );

// example: quoted properties
book["ISBN code"] = "12345ABC";
console.log( book["ISBN code"] ); // could I write   book.ISBN code  ?? 


var book2 = { topic: "Discworld", fat: false , author:  "Terry Pratchett" };
console.log( book , " & " , book2 );
// remove a property
delete book.author;
console.log( book , " & " , book2 );
console.log("author" in book); // is there a property called "author"?
console.log("author" in book2); // is there a property called "author"?
