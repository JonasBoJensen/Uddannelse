/* 
Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. 
English is translated to Pig Latin by:
- taking the first letter of every word, 
- moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. 

"the quick brown fox" becomes "hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay".

[hint]
Start solving the problem for a single word: "andrea" -> "ndreaay"
Then consider what happens with a string containing many words.
