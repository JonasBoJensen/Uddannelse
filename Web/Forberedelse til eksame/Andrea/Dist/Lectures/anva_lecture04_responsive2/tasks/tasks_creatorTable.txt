Task - Reactive Tables for Quizzes

Work in pairs
Given a table about the quizzes that a creator is currently working on (see folder tasks)
Make the table ”responsive” 
using 2 of the methods discussed before
but first: decide which info are more important and how the table should look like when on small screens
Test your solutions by resizing the browser window
you should have at least 2 versions, 1 for small and 1 for large screens



Task - icons in the table

Work in pairs
Use spriteCow to add icons to your table (task 1). For example an icon can show if a quiz is published or not, and there could be an icon to symbolize the topic of a quiz (out of a palette of a few possible topics)
- use icons from http://www.freepik.com/free-icons/  to add icons to your table
- use GIMP (for example) to compose all the icons you need in a single large image
- then use spriteCow to find the coordinates for the CSS of each icon you want, from the large image
test your table with icons, for small and large screens


Task - require

Start from the original code in task 1 (folder tasks)
Rewrite it using requirejs
- put the definition of data in a module
- create a function that creates the table, that returns a string with the table definition, and takes the data as input parameter. Make a second module just for the function 
- require both modules and use them in your main javascript module to create the table
