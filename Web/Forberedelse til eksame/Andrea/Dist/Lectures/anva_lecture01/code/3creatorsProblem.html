<h1>3 creators problem</h1>
<p>
	There are 3 quiz creators in the Quiz-R-Us system, called Alex, Bob and Clint:
	<ul>
		<li>Alex is 45 years old, is female and has created 8 quizzes so far, and she got a total of 150 likes </li>
		<li>Bob (male) is 21, has created 13 quizzes and got a total of 230 likes</li>
		<li>Clint (male) is 32, has 4 quizzes and a total of 69 likes</li>
	</ul>
	A quiz creator is successful if he/she has many likes, relative to how many quizzes he/she has created
	<br>You need to find who among the 3 creators is second-best
</p>

<p>
Proceed as follows:
<ul style="color:red">
<li>find out which variables can represent each creator,</li>
<li>define the steps she has to take to decide which creator is the second-best,</li>
<li>implement your solution in Javascript using a function for each step of the top-down analysis</li>
</ul>
Open javascript console to see the result.
