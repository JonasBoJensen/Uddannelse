Exercise 2
==========

Work with a responsive page. In the code I'm using a Foundation grid.
The text in the example is taken from the book Postsingular by R. Rucker.


1) Change the HTML page so that the paragraph with title 'From Chpt 2: "Nant Day"' 
only occupies 10 columns on a large screen, and 11 on a small screen.

2) Change again the HTML page. Add a new DIV with a picture of the cover of the book.
Give it a title like 'Cover' using headline h3.
I provided the cover image in file: images/cover.jpg
Place the cover image to the left of the section with title 'Original text', in the same row as
'Original text' and 'Author' sections.
On large screen the 3 sections in that row should occupy:
-> 5 colums - 'Cover'
-> 2 colums - 'Original text'
-> 5 colums - 'Author' 
On a small screen instead:
-> 3 colums - 'Cover'
-> 3 colums - 'Original text'
-> 6 colums - 'Author' 

3) Add a div on top of the page, with 3 DIVs inside. Place the following text inside
the 3 DIVs (left to right): 'sideImageLeft', 'TITLE' and 'sideImageRight' 
(see image screenshot07.png and screenshot08.png)
On large screens the 3 DIVs should occupy 2, 8 and 2 columns respectively;
on small screens the 3 DIVs should be the same size.




Images:
- screenshot01.png => shows the page on a small screen
- screenshot02.png => shows the page on a large screen

- screenshot03.png => shows the page after point 1 is solved (on a small screen)
- screenshot04.png => shows the page after point 1 is solved (on a large screen)

- screenshot05.png => shows the page after point 2 is solved (on a small screen)
- screenshot06.png => shows the page after point 2 is solved (on a large screen)

- screenshot07.png => shows the page after point 3 is solved (on a small screen)
- screenshot07.png => shows the page after point 3 is solved (on a large screen)
