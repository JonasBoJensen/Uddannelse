Exercise 4
==========

Look at the file: solarSystem.html

For a game, you need to generate a description of a solar system that has from 5 to 10 planets
      (use a random value to decide how many).
      Each planet can have: 
         - and 0 to 5 continents (use a random value to decide how many)
		 - an ocean (10% probability)
	  Each ocean can have:
		 - aquatic life (10% probability)
         
Using jQuery:
1) Write a program that generates a random solar system, using
   nested DIVs to represent the planets, continents, and oceans and aquatic life.

2) When the user clicks the button, create a new DIV representing a space ship (give it the class 'spaceship').
   If there is at least a planet in your solar system that has aquatic life, put the spacesphip inside the DIV of
   that planet. 
   If in your current solar system there are no planets with aquatic life, then place your spaceship on the 
   3rd planet.

and image spaceshipLanded.png shows the result after pressing the button to land the spaceship.
