Exercise 1
==========

Look in the file book.html

There is a constructor function for the Book data-type.
In this program:
- A book has a title and a number of pages. 
- A book can provide its own description, with a toString method.

What you have to do:
1) Finish implementing the Book constructor, so that each Book object
   actually has the right attributes.
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the 
   assertions in the file, in section:
       // 1) testing the Book constructor
   should pass correctly, without errors.
   
2) Finish implementing the toString function, so that it
   returns a string describing the current book.
   For example, a book with title 'Abc' and 567 pages, will be described as:
      'Book "Abc" 567 pages'
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the 
   assertions in the file, in section:  
      // 2) testing the toString method
      
3) Now you should create 3 book objects, and place them into an array.
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the 
   assertions in the file, in section:  
      // 3) testing an array of books
      
4) Print the title for each book in the array. Use a for-loop.
   To be sure that your job is done, when you are done the 
   assertions in the file, in section:  
      // 4) print the titles of all books in the array.
