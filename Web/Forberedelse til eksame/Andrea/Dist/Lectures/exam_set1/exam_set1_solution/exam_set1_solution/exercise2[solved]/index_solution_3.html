    <h3>From Chpt 2: "Nant Day"</h3>
    <p>
	Ond wasn't around as much as before - he was putting in long hours at the Nantel labs in the China Basin biotech district of San Francisco. 
	The project remained secret until the day President Dick Dibbs announced that the US was going to rocket an eggcase of nants to Mars. 
	The semiliving micron-sized dust specks had been programmed to turn Mars entirely into - more nants! 
	Ten-to-the-thirty-ninth nants, to be precise, each of them with a billion bytes of memory and a computational engine cranking along 
	at a billion updates a second. 
	The nants would spread out across the celestial sphere of the Mars orbit, populating it with a swarm that 
	would in effect become a quakkaflop quakkabyte solar-powered computer, the greatest intellectual resource ever under the control of man, 
	a Dyson sphere with a radius of a quarter-billion kilometers.
