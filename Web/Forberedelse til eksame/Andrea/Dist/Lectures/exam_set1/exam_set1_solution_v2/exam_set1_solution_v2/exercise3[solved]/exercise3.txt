Exercise 3
==========

Look in the files:
- exercise03.html
- js/tripList.js

The tripList.js file define a TripList data-type, that represents a list of
things to bring to a trip.

In the HTLM file you can see that an object of TripList type is created, using
the constructor function.
In the HTML page the trip is called 'My fantastic trip to Kathmandu (Nepal)'.

In the HMTL page there is also a form, with text inputs and buttons.

1) Using jQuery, write an event handler for the click event of the 'addItem' button
so that when the button is clicked, the text in 'itemTextInput' is appended in the 'mainArea' DIV.
Then clear the text in 'itemTextInput', so the user can input something else.
NOTE: remember to add your items also to the TripList object, each time the 'addItem' button is clicked.

2) Modify the handler you just wrote for the 'addItem' button, so that it also 
writes the number of items currently in the list, in the last DIV of the page.

3) Using jQuery, write an event handler for the click event of the 'reset' button
so that when the button is clicked, all text in the 'mainArea' DIV is erased.
After your clicked the 'reset' button, the user can input a new item: 
the 'mainArea' will show only that last item, and the total number of items will be 1.
