1- 
. Consider the the Quiz-R-us player page
. What does the player need? See: Quiz_R_Us.docx for inspiration and data about what will be needed in the main page   for a player:
  - perhaps a list of newly available quizzes
  - personal high-scores and those of friends
  - a history (of past quizzes) and/or a list of all unfinished quizzes
  - ... 
. Make 2 wireframes for the player page:
  - first make a wireframe for the mobile version of the page (mobile-first)
  - then make another for the laptop version of the same page
. The result should be 2 wireframe sketches of how the page/site would look like on a mobile device and on a laptop


2- 
Take your 2 wireframe pages from exercise 1, and put each one into a grid layout.
Find out column widths, in a 12 cols layout.
The result should be a copy of your wireframe images, with 12 columns marked.


3- 
. Choose 1 type/style of menu for your player page
  - Which kind? 
  - How will it change from mobile to laptop?
  - Discuss/explain and write down your decision and alternatives (in pairs)
. Design it: just sketch the menu (implementation later)
. Remember: mobile-first approach, but it should work also on laptop...


4- 
Finish up the exercises we did today in a coherent, ”usable” page: see folder task-playerPage\
Decide about fonts and colors: 
check out https://www.viget.com/articles/color-contrast for a nice intro to colors and combinations
Implement your wireframe page:
- use a 12 grid menu
- implement it with foundation4 (see previous example) or bootstrap, you decide which one you’d like to use
- implement your menu for the player page
- images can be (1) found on google images or (2) faked with http://placehold.it/ 

The result should be a working page, but with fake, static data about a player and his/her quizzes
