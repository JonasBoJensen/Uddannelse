Task - quiz editor
------------------

I would like to have a page in which: 
- see a table with my data, as creator of quizzes. All the quizzes I currently   have created should be listed (none initially)
- have a button to add a new quiz. When the ”add-quiz” button is clicked, 
  some data are asked and then inserted in the table, including:
	title, 
 	list of questions, 
	list of possible answers per question, 
	list of correct answers, 
	and list of topics
Next time I open the page the table should still remember all my data from previous time I opened it (persistence)

See example: 01_localstorage/editor_v4.html 

===========================================

Start from the code in 01_localstorage/editor_v4.html 

A- Add an icon [x] (delete.png) to the end of each row of the Books and of the Actors tables.
B- Add events, so that when the [x] icon is clicked, that row is erased from the
Books or Actors data in the myData object; and the tables should be re-generated.
  Main problem: how to find out, given the row where the icon is clicked, which data to
  remove from the myData object (and its internal arrays)?
