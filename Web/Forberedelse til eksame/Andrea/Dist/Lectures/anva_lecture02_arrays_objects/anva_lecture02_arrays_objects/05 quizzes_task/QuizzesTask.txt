============================================


A) Decide how to represent the data above; for example you could use arrays
of strings, or objects, or arrays of arrays. 
Write down you decision and be sure you can represent all the data above
in your data model.

B) Write a progra that declares and initializes the data above (according
to your design for the data model), then:
- print all questions of the quiz "is your spirit free". After each question
print all its possible answers and mark the correct answer (for example
put a "(*)" near each correct answer, for each question).
The printed quiz should look like this:

	is your spirit free?
	=> how does it feel to be a rain drop?
	===> cold
	===> blue
	===> flying (*)
	=> clouds are...
	===> fluffy (*)
	===> water vapor
	===> bad. Sunny is better

C) in the same program as B), add some code to print also the total number of likes, for each of the quiz creators. The result should look something like:

	- creators -
	Andrea got a total of 455 likes for 2 quiz
	Bob got a total of 1 likes for 1 quiz
