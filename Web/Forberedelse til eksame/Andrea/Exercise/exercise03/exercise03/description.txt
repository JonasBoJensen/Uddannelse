  NOTE: this exercise is more difficult than any you will get in the exam.
        It is however good for practicing.

Look in the file city.html

Generate a description of a city that has from 4 to 10 buildings
(use a random value to decide how many).
Each building can have: 
         - a rotten roof -> 50% probability of having it
         - and 0 to 4 persons living in it (use a random value to decide how many)
A rotten roof can have:
         - a rat living in it -> 40% probability of having it
         
Using jQuery:
      1) Write a program that generates a random city, using
         nested DIVs to represent the buildings, rotten roofs and rats.
         Use spans to represet individual persons.
         So a building with a rotten roof, a rat inside it, and 3 persons should
         be representend like this:
            <div class='building'>building5
                <div class='rottenRoof'>rotten roof
                    <div class='rat'>rat</div>
                </div>
                <span class='person'>person</span>
                <span class='person'>person</span>
                <span class='person'>person</span>
            </div>
      2) When the user clicks the 'Burn it down!' button, burn all buildings with a
         rotten roof, but no people and no rats inside.            
         NOTE: 'burn' here means set a class .burned to a building 
         So it is possible that sometimes the button has no visible effect.
         
      3) When the user clicks the 'Evacuate' button, remove all people from 
         building with rotten roofs.
         Since this button removes person spans, you can test it together with the
         first button, to see if after you remove people from building with rotten roof
         you can burn down more buildings.         
         
      4) Add a new button, to remove all rats from all buildings. 
         Write the jQuery handler and test it.
