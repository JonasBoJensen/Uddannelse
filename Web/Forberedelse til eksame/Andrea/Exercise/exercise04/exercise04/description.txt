  NOTE: this exercise is more difficult than any you will get in the exam.
        It is however good for practicing.

Look in the files city_creation.html  and  city_visualization.html 
The first file generates a random city, then stores it in an object and saves the object
in the localstorage.
The second file retreives the city object from localstorage and creates a structure made
of DIVs to represent the city.


The city that has from 4 to 10 buildings (use a random value to decide how many).
Each building can have: 
         - a rotten roof -> 50% probability of having it
         - and 0 to 4 persons living in it (use a random value to decide how many)
A rotten roof can have:
         - a rat living in it -> 40% probability of having it
         

Using jQuery:
1) Write a program that generates a random city. Use objects and arrays if needed
   to represent you city. Then save your city in localStorage with the key
   'myCityData'.

2) Read the object describing the city from localstorage, using the key 'myCityData'
 Then generate a city in this page, using nested DIVs to represent the 
 buildings, rotten roofs and rats.
 Use spans to represet individual persons.
 So a building with a rotten roof, a rat inside it, and 3 persons should
 be representend like this:
    <div class='building'>building5
        <div class='rottenRoof'>rotten roof
            <div class='rat'>rat</div>
        </div>
        <span class='person'>person</span>
        <span class='person'>person</span>
        <span class='person'>person</span>
    </div>
3) When the user clicks the 'Burn it down!' button, burn all buildings with a
 rotten roof, but no people and no rats inside.            
 NOTE: 'burn' here means set a class .burned to a building 
 So it is possible that sometimes the button has no visible effect.

4) When the user clicks the 'Evacuate' button, remove all people from 
 building with rotten roofs.
 Since this button removes person spans, you can test it together with the
 first button, to see if after you remove people from building with rotten roof
 you can burn down more buildings.         

5) Add a new button, to remove all rats from all buildings. 
 Write the jQuery handler and test it.
